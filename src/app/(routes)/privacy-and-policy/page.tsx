        We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal
        information while you use Wild Curiosity. This policy explains what data
        we collect, how we use it, and your rights. When you create an account,
        we collect basic information such as your name, email address, and any
        profile details you provide. We also collect content you share,
        including posts, photos, and videos. To improve your experience, we may
        gather usage data like app activity and device information. Your
        information is used to personalize the app, facilitate social
        interactions, and manage events and workshops. We do not sell or rent
        your personal data to third parties. However, we may share necessary
        data with trusted service providers who help us operate the app, always
        under strict confidentiality. We implement industry-standard security
        measures to protect your data, but no system is completely secure. You
        are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential. You
        have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information.
        You can also control what content you share publicly within the app. By
        using our app, you agree to this Privacy Policy. We may update it
        occasionally, and your continued use means acceptance of those changes.
        Key Points: We collect personal info you provide and data from your app
        usage. Data is used to improve your experience and enable social
        features. We do not sell your personal information. Trusted partners may
        have limited access to data for app operations. Security measures
        protect your data, but no guarantee of absolute security. You control
        your profile and content sharing settings. You can request access to or
        deletion of your personal data. Continued use after updates means you
        accept the updated policy. Thank you for trusting us with your
        information as we build a sustainable community together.
